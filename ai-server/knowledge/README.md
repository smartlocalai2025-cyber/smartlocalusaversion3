# Morrow.AI Knowledge Base

Drop .md, .txt, or .json files here. Morrow.AI loads them on startup and will use simple keyword search
(across titles and content) to surface relevant snippets. Keep files small (<=10KB per file slice)
and prefer concise, high-signal references.

Examples:
- playbooks/local-seo-checklist.md
- prompts/seo-analysis-system.md
- providers/latency-observations.json
