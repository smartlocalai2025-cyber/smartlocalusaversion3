```

**NEW Audit Output with Live Data:**
```
‚Ä¢ Rating (3.2/5) is 0.9 points below local avg (4.1) - implement review recovery plan
‚Ä¢ Missing 3 key categories competitors use: "Italian Restaurant", "Pizza Delivery"  
‚Ä¢ Only 12 photos vs competitor average of 28 - add interior, menu, team photos
‚Ä¢ 15 negative reviews mention "slow service" - operational priority #1
‚Ä¢ Top competitor Tony's Pizza (4.3/5, 89 reviews) gains 23% more Sunday traffic
```

## üìà Data Transformation Examples

### Rating Analysis
**Before**: "Implement review ask cadence"  
**After**: "Rating (3.2/5) is 0.9 points below local average (4.1). Top competitor Luigi's Pizza has 4.3/5 with 89 reviews. Implement review recovery plan targeting recent negative feedback about service speed."

### Category Optimization  
**Before**: "Optimize business categories"  
**After**: "Missing 3 categories that 80% of local competitors use: 'Italian Restaurant', 'Pizza Delivery', 'Family Restaurant'. Adding these could improve discovery for 23% more relevant searches."

### Photo Strategy
**Before**: "Add more photos to GBP"  
**After**: "Current 12 photos vs competitor average of 28. Competitors with 25+ photos average 34% higher engagement. Priority: interior shots (missing), menu photos (missing), team photos (missing)."

### Hours Optimization
**Before**: "Ensure hours are accurate"  
**After**: "Currently closed Sundays while competitor Tony's Pizza captures 23% of weekly traffic on Sundays. Consider Sunday hours expansion - potential 15% revenue increase based on local search volume."
